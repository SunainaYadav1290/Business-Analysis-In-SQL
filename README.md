BrickHouse Restaurant Case Study by Sunaina Yadav

## Problem Statement
Varun wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

### Datasets
Three datasets tables was provided for this project analysis.

### Sales:
The sales table captures all customer_id level purchases with a corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.

### Menu:
The menu table maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.

### Members:
The members table captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.

### Business Questions
